Maven Fluid Skin
================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yay - finally! A modern, decent looking, HTML5/CSS3 based, fluid layout project
documentation web site skin for Maven projects. Based on the
[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework for rapid development of
fluid design websites - this is simple bliss for your Maven documentation.

[View an example site](http://olle.github.com/maven-fluid-skin/) (yes meta).

Build and install
-----------------

Currently there's no release, we're still in `SNAPSHOT` mode, but you can
easily build and install the skin yourself.

    git clone git://github.com/olle/maven-fluid-skin.git
    cd maven-fluid-skin
    mvn install

Well, just what you would expect if you know your way around with Maven. This
builds and installs the skin to your local `.m2` repository, making it
available for your local builds.

**COMING SOON:** A release version will be built and deployed soon, and made
available at the [Sonatype OSS Repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/). Stay
tuned for more information.
